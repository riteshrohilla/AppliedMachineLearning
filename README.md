## Assignment 1

Assignment: Titanic Survival Prediction
Objective:
The goal of this assignment is to build a predictive model that determines whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on various features.

Dataset:
You will be using the Titanic dataset, which contains information about the passengers on the Titanic. The dataset includes the following features:

PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger
Pclass: Passenger class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
Name: Name of the passenger
Sex: Gender of the passenger
Age: Age of the passenger
SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic
Parch: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic
Ticket: Ticket number
Fare: Amount of money paid for the ticket
Cabin: Cabin number
Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)
Survived: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes) [This is the target variable]
Instructions:
Data Preprocessing:

Load the dataset and inspect its structure.
Handle any missing values appropriately.
Convert categorical variables into numeric representations (e.g., using one-hot encoding).
Feature scaling if necessary.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Perform EDA to understand the relationship between different features and the target variable.
Visualize the data using appropriate plots (e.g., histograms, box plots, bar plots).
Model Building:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train at least three different classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM).
Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
Use cross-validation to ensure the robustness of your model.
Model Evaluation and Selection:

Compare the performance of the different models.
Select the best model based on the evaluation metrics.
Provide a rationale for your selection.
Model Improvement:

Perform hyperparameter tuning on the best model to improve its performance.
Discuss any additional techniques you used to enhance the model.
Submission:

Submit a Jupyter notebook with your code, explanations, and visualizations.
Include a summary of your findings and the final modelâ€™s performance.
Deliverables:
A Jupyter notebook file (.ipynb) containing:

Data preprocessing steps
Exploratory data analysis
Model training and evaluation
Model improvement steps
Summary of findings
